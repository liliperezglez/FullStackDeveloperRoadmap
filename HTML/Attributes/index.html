<!--You're already familiar with the <img> tag from the previous exercise. 
This tag embeds an image in the page. This tag has a few important attributes:
src - the image URL. This attribute is mandatory for the <img> element.
alt - this attribute defines the alternative text describing the image. 
Users will see this text displayed if the image URL is wrong or if the image is not yet downloaded.
height - the intrinsic height of the image in pixels.
width - the intrinsic width of the image in pixels.
You need to create an HTML document with an image. Feel free to set any values 
for src and alt attributes.-->
